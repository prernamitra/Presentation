            <p class="mb-0">Scared that Ice creams will increase the flab? Are you always counting calories? We replace the Ice cream with frozen yogurt for all of you! The best part about the treat is that it is full of healthy benefits. Protein, calcium, potassium and numerous vitamins fill the cup. These elements are so good for you that they can boost your immune system, lower your cholesterol, and help your digestive system. Looks like we all should be eating a little more frozen yogurt! Yogurt is created by adding good bacteria to milk. This is why yogurt has unique qualities. The healthy cultures ferment and convert the lactose into lactic acid, creating the tart flavor of yogurt that we know and love. This is also why some who suffer from lactose intolerance are able to tolerate frozen yogurt, even if they can not digest milk very well. The protein in yogurt will make you feel more feel for a longer period of time than you would if you ate a different kind of sugary snack or dessert. This is part of what makes eating frozen yogurt helpful when trying to lose weight. Carbohydrate filled desserts will disperse quickly, leaving you hungry. Even non carbohydrate desserts that contain a lot of sugar will not fill you up like yogurt would. With experience we have developed new types of frozen yogurt, just like ice cream. You've got your soft serve styles as well as the hand scooped frozen yogurt or even smoothies, frozen yogurt cakes, and pies. Pretty much anything ice cream can do, frozen yogurt can do healthier! So walk in to indulge absolutely guilt-free.</p>
